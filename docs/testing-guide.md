# Testing Guide

## Overview
This testing suite provides comprehensive validation of the assignment availability feature and database relationship integrity. It helps catch common errors and ensures the system works correctly.

## Test Suites

### 1. Database Relationship Tests (`test-database-relationships.js`)
**Purpose**: Validates database schema integrity and relationship queries.

**Tests Covered**:
- ‚úÖ **Schema Validation**: Verifies Course model has correct fields
- ‚úÖ **Relationship Integrity**: Tests Course ‚Üí Subject ‚Üí Organization chain
- ‚úÖ **Valid Assignment Filtering**: Tests correct relationship queries
- ‚úÖ **Invalid Field Prevention**: Ensures invalid fields are rejected
- ‚úÖ **Error Handling**: Validates proper error responses

**Common Errors Caught**:
- `Unknown argument 'organizationId'` on Course model
- `Unknown argument 'yearLevel'` on Course model
- Incorrect relationship paths in queries
- Missing or broken foreign key relationships

### 2. Assignment Availability Tests (`test-assignment-availability.js`)
**Purpose**: Tests the complete assignment availability feature.

**Tests Covered**:
- ‚úÖ **Assignment Creation**: Tests creating assignments with availability dates
- ‚úÖ **Availability Filtering**: Tests date-based visibility rules
- ‚úÖ **Assignment Editing**: Tests updating availability dates
- ‚úÖ **Publishing Controls**: Tests draft vs published assignments
- ‚úÖ **Student Visibility**: Tests what students can see
- ‚úÖ **Invalid Field Handling**: Tests error handling

**Features Tested**:
- Teacher can set `availableFrom` and `availableTo` dates
- Students only see assignments within availability windows
- Future assignments are hidden from students
- Draft assignments are hidden from students
- Assignment editing preserves availability settings

## Running Tests

### Quick Database Test
```bash
npm run test:quick
```
Runs only the database relationship tests (fastest).

### Database Tests Only
```bash
npm run test:database
```
Runs comprehensive database relationship validation.

### Assignment Tests Only
```bash
npm run test:assignments
```
Runs assignment availability feature tests (requires backend running).

### Full Test Suite
```bash
npm run test
```
Runs all tests (both database and assignment tests).

## Test Output

### Successful Test Run
```
üß™ Starting Database Relationship Tests...

==================================================
Running: Schema Validation
==================================================
‚úÖ Course model schema validation passed

==================================================
Running: Relationship Integrity
==================================================
‚úÖ All relationships verified

üéâ ALL DATABASE RELATIONSHIP TESTS PASSED!
‚úÖ Your database schema is correctly configured
‚úÖ All relationship queries are working properly
‚úÖ Invalid field access is properly prevented
```

### Failed Test Run
```
‚ùå Invalid organizationId query correctly rejected
‚ùå Course organization relationship test failed: Course -> Subject -> Organization relationship broken
‚ö†Ô∏è Some database relationship tests failed.
üîß Please check the schema and fix any relationship issues.
```

## Error Prevention

### Database Relationship Errors
The tests specifically catch these common errors:

1. **Invalid OrganizationId Query**:
   ```javascript
   // ‚ùå WRONG - Course doesn't have organizationId
   course: { organizationId: student.organizationId }
   
   // ‚úÖ CORRECT - Use the relationship path
   course: { subject: { organizationId: student.organizationId } }
   ```

2. **Invalid YearLevel Query**:
   ```javascript
   // ‚ùå WRONG - Course doesn't have yearLevel
   course: { yearLevel: 'P1' }
   
   // ‚úÖ CORRECT - Use Classroom for yearLevel
   classroom: { yearLevel: 'P1' }
   ```

3. **Broken Relationships**:
   ```javascript
   // ‚ùå WRONG - Missing relationship chain
   course: { organizationId: orgId }
   
   // ‚úÖ CORRECT - Full relationship chain
   course: { subject: { organizationId: orgId } }
   ```

### Assignment Availability Errors
The tests catch these assignment-related issues:

1. **Missing Availability Dates**:
   ```javascript
   // ‚ùå WRONG - No availability control
   const assignment = { title: 'Test', published: true }
   
   // ‚úÖ CORRECT - With availability dates
   const assignment = { 
     title: 'Test', 
     published: true,
     availableFrom: new Date(),
     availableTo: new Date(Date.now() + 7 * 24 * 60 * 60 * 1000)
   }
   ```

2. **Incorrect Filtering**:
   ```javascript
   // ‚ùå WRONG - No date filtering
   where: { published: true }
   
   // ‚úÖ CORRECT - With date filtering
   where: {
     published: true,
     OR: [
       { availableFrom: null, availableTo: null },
       { availableFrom: { lte: new Date() }, availableTo: null },
       { availableFrom: null, availableTo: { gte: new Date() } },
       { availableFrom: { lte: new Date() }, availableTo: { gte: new Date() } }
     ]
   }
   ```

## Continuous Integration

### Pre-commit Hook
Add this to your `.git/hooks/pre-commit`:
```bash
#!/bin/bash
npm run test:database
if [ $? -ne 0 ]; then
  echo "‚ùå Database tests failed. Please fix before committing."
  exit 1
fi
echo "‚úÖ Database tests passed."
```

### CI/CD Pipeline
Add this to your CI pipeline:
```yaml
- name: Run Database Tests
  run: npm run test:database

- name: Run Assignment Tests
  run: npm run test:assignments
  env:
    DATABASE_URL: ${{ secrets.DATABASE_URL }}
```

## Troubleshooting

### Common Test Failures

1. **Database Connection Issues**:
   ```bash
   # Check if database is running
   pg_isready -h localhost -p 5432
   
   # Check environment variables
   echo $DATABASE_URL
   ```

2. **Schema Mismatch**:
   ```bash
   # Regenerate Prisma client
   npm run prisma:generate
   
   # Run migrations
   npm run prisma:migrate
   ```

3. **Backend Not Running**:
   ```bash
   # Start backend for assignment tests
   npm run dev
   
   # In another terminal, run tests
   npm run test:assignments
   ```

### Test Data Cleanup
If tests fail and leave test data:
```bash
# Connect to database and clean up
psql $DATABASE_URL
DELETE FROM organizations WHERE name = 'Test Organization';
```

## Best Practices

### Running Tests Regularly
1. **Before Committing**: Run `npm run test:database`
2. **Before Deploying**: Run `npm run test`
3. **After Schema Changes**: Run `npm run test:database`
4. **After Feature Changes**: Run `npm run test:assignments`

### Test Maintenance
1. **Update Tests**: When adding new features, add corresponding tests
2. **Review Failures**: Always investigate test failures
3. **Keep Tests Fast**: Database tests should run quickly
4. **Isolate Tests**: Each test should be independent

### Debugging Failed Tests
1. **Check Logs**: Look for specific error messages
2. **Verify Data**: Ensure test data is created correctly
3. **Check Relationships**: Verify foreign key relationships
4. **Test Manually**: Try the failing operation manually

3. Ensure all dependencies are installed
4. Check environment variables are set correctly

For feature-related issues:
